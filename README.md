### Summary: 
It's a single screen as per instructions. I just display recipes with name, cuisine and small photo. 
For small photo, I use image caching. 

### Focus Areas:
There was nothing specific to prioritize, just normal flow. I started with project and MVVM (Network manager, Model, ViewModel, View (UI)), then cached image, and unit tests. 
    Used ChatGPT - Swift Copilot to help with cached image and unit testing. It helped by adding protocols so it generated mocks for easier testing. 

### Time Spent:
It took couple of hours total, but it could be less. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions:
Nothing special, no trade-offs.

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
It's just a simple take home assignment, it's hard to think of any weakest part. 

### Additional Information: 
No additional information at the moment
